# Patterns for mocking APIs

This repo is a companion to the blog post.

It contains working Java code samples for four patterns of mocking an API:
1. Mocking the API client
2. Mocking HTTP calls within a unit test
3. Using a mocked API class to move HTTP mocks out of the unit test
4. Using a mocked API in conjunction with validation against the OpenAPI spec

See `src/test/java` for the examples.
